A repository to document my Python learning journey

About Me
Hi! My name is Matthew Ju and I am a senior at Lynbrook High School. I am primarily interested in exploring the intersection between physics and computer engineering, as well as AI/ML.

Goals for This Course
I hope to expand my fundamentals in Python and get more immersed into AI/ML.

My First Python Program
print("Hello, World!")
