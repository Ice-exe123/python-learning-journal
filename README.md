# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey

# About Me
Hi! My name is Matthew Ju and I am a senior at Lynbrook High School. I am primarily interested in exploring the intersection between physics, computer engineering, and AI/ML. I also enjoy learning about scientific computation and groundbreaking research-driven projects. My interests in finance are more hidden, but I do try to regularly follow curent events.

# Goals for This Course
In this course I have three primary goals:
- expand my fundamentals in Python to write cleaner and more efficient code
- get more immersed into AI/ML techniques and how to apply them to my current projects
- apply computational methods to scientific and engineering problems
- learn different modules and libraries that I can utilize later
- learn fundamental terminology that I missed when self-studying

# My First Python Program
print("Hello, World!")
