- What object oriented programming is: programming paradigm organizing code into objects (classes)
- Core OOP concepts: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation (building data and methods within class)
- Non-OOP approaches: procedural, functional, imperative programming
- Fundamentals of data structures: linear data structures (lists, stacks, queues), non-linear DS (trees, graphs, heaps), hashing-based structures (dictionaries)
- Algorithms: sorting (bubble, merge, quickshort), search (linear, binary), graph
- Abstract data types: list, stack, queue, set
